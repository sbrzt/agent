# Name
Modeling Temporal Granularity in Historical Events

# Description
A historical archive contains records of events, some precisely dated and others more vague. For instance, the sinking of the Titanic is recorded as April 15, 1912, while the construction of Stonehenge is only known to have occurred around 3000 BC. A system is needed to consistently represent and query these events, regardless of the precision of their temporal information.

# Examples
- Event: Sinking of the Titanic, Date: April 15, 1912
- Event: Construction of Stonehenge, Date: Approximately 3000 BC
